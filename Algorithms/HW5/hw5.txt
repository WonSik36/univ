	Algorithm Analysis(ITP) HW5

	21300691 Cheung Won Sik

	How to Compile Code to Program
	1. (on command line) gcc hw5.c -o hw5.out
	2. It should be compiled in mac, linux operating system

	How to Execute Program
	1. (on command line) ./hw5.out
	   -> It automatically use "hw5.data" to input data
	2. (on command line) ./hw5.out (file_name)
	   -> use "file_name" to input data

	Input File Assumption
	1. given data's column and row order should be same

	Return of program
	1.Array of adjacency list of given graph
	2.Run Bellman-Ford's algorithm and print result & running time
	3.Run Dijtstra's algorithm and print result & running time
	4.Run Floyd-Warshall's algorithm and print result & running time

	Screenshot
	1.png : example of given data (hw5.data)
	2.png : example of given data with graph which has negative weight edge (test1.data)
	3.png : example of graph data with graph which has negative weight cycle (test2.data)
